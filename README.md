# NeoVim configuration for PHP and JavaScript (WordPress and Gutenberg) development

Here is the Work in Progress to configure NeoVim as the perfect IDE for WordPress development

## TODO
- [x] Use PHPCS for diagnostics
- [x] Make markdown wrap
- [x] Auto install `jsonls`, `yaml`, `dockerls`, `sumneko_lua`, `bashls`, `gramarly`
- [ ] Install and configure a [Git](https://github.com/TimUntersberger/neogit) management extension
- [ ] Install and configure a [Git Blame](https://github.com/f-person/git-blame.nvim) extension
- [ ] Install and configure a [File explorer](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua) extension
- [ ] Add alignment plugin (EasyAlign)
- [ ] Format with `:Format` command or using `null-ls` plugin
- [ ] Try to use [lspkind](https://github.com/onsails/lspkind-nvim) without cmp in Telescope and see if it works
- [ ] Verify it works on React
- [ ] Configure language server [using json](https://github.com/tamago324/nlsp-settings.nvim) instead of lua (allows you to have config per-project)
